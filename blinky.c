/*
  Blink
  Turns on an LED on for one second, then off for one second, repeatedly.
 
  This example code is in the public domain.
  
  Write a program that blinks S-O-S morse code when uses presses the button. The code is: dot, dot,
dot, dash, dash, dash, dot, dot, dot, (long pause if code repeats). The length of dash is three times
the lengt of a dot. The off time between dots and dashes is one dot long. For example, if dot lenght
is 0.5 seconds the sequence is 0.5s ON, 0,5 s OFF, 0,5 ON, 0,5 s OFF, 0.5 s ON, 0.5 s OFF, 1.5 ON, 0.5 s
OFF, 1.5 s ON, â€¦
After the sequence the program goes back to wait for another button press to start S-O-S again.
